Identify problem or goal - the evil green pigs need to be defeated so launch the angry bird from a psi launcher and predict where it will land to knock down the green pig

Identify resources and constraints - laser cutting, 3d printing, wood carvings, pico, foam

Brainstorm ideas - Angry Birds launcher (either chuck or bomb for the design)

Pick a solution - use an altimeter to gather data on distance from the ground (use the data for a graph in Google Sheets maybe)
